      "snippet": "Known to most as Gold Roger, was the Pirate King, captain of the Roger Pirates, and owner of the legendary treasure known as 'One Piece'.He was also the lover of Portgas D. Rouge and biological father of Portgas D. Ace. Born in Loguetown, Roger was famed as the man who did what no one thought possible - conquering the Grand Line. It would seem that he had been around for some time, considering that Brook refers to him as a rookie, more than 50 years before the current storyline. Before he formed his crew, he met Silvers Rayleigh, a young man who was living on a ship he had stolen after his house had burnt down. Roger said that it was a fated meeting and asked Rayleigh to join him. \n Unavoidable FateEdit \nTwenty-six years before the start of the story, Roger came down with an incurable disease. He decided to pitch one last journey with his crew into the Grand Line. Upon reaching the lighthouse at Reverse Mountain, at the entrance of the Grand Line, he recruited Crocus as his doctor to keep him alive for 3 years before the completion of his journey. \n Their journey took them to Skypiea and later Water 7, where the shipwright Tom built them a ship called the Oro Jackson. \n Two of the most powerful opponents Roger faced on his journey were Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp and the pirate Edward 'Whitebeard' Newgate. The former is said to have cornered him many times on the journey, and the latter was the closest rival to his title. It is said that Whitebeard was the only one capable of matching Roger in combat.",

They are the main focus and protagonists of the anime and manga One Piece, and are led by the main protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy. The 'Straw Hats' are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by Red-Haired Shanks, and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in Alabasta. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. After the Enies Lobby Arc, they obtain a new ship called the Thousand Sunny. The Straw Hats currently consist of nine members whose combined bounties equal Beli1,570,000,100[1]. Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all nine members were separated from one another. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since become an active and massive force in the New World.",

After awakening Kenbunshoku Haki, he became the fourth member of the Straw Hat crew to demonstrate and use a form of Haki. His current bounty, Beli200,000,000, is a huge jump from his original, due to his role as 'God' for saving all those toy slaves in Doflamingo's underground trades; this takes him from the third lowest bounty of the crew to the third highest, jumping past the previous holder, Nico Robin.",
